    <p style="color:black; font-size: 150%">Objects, in JavaScript, is it is most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).</p>
<p style="color:black; font-size: 150%">
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables do not actually store the value.</p>

<p style = "color:black; font-size: 150%">Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>

<p style="color:black; font-size: 150%">For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.</p>
